This is a simple Javascript and HTML web page that allows to move the ball across the field to a click.

Requirements:

The ball center should come exactly under the pointer on click (if possible without crossing the field edge).
CSS-animation is welcome.
The ball must not cross field boundaries.
When the page is scrolled, nothing should break.
